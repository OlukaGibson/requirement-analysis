# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## Introduction
Welcome to the Requirement Analysis repository. This project focuses on understanding, defining, and documenting software requirements as part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to requirement analysis concepts, methodologies, and practical examples using a booking management system as a case study.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a process within the SDLC where software requirements are gathered, examined, and clearly defined to ensure that the final software product meets user expectations. It involves engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs, constraints, and expectations for the software system.

This process is essential because it lays the groundwork for all subsequent stages of software development. A clear understanding of what needs to be built reduces misunderstandings, scope creep, and costly changes later in the project lifecycle.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Improves Clarity and Understanding
Requirement Analysis helps both developers and stakeholders to have a shared understanding of the system’s expectations and functionality.

- Minimizes Risks
Identifying requirements early helps uncover potential issues, dependencies, and risks before development begins.

- Enhances Project Planning and Estimation
With well-defined requirements, teams can better estimate time, effort, cost, and resources required for the project.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Gathering
Collecting high-level business needs from stakeholders, users, and other sources.

- Requirement Elicitation
Actively engaging with users and stakeholders through interviews, questionnaires, observations, or workshops to refine the requirements.

- Requirement Documentation
Clearly writing down the gathered requirements in formats such as BRD (Business Requirements Document), SRS (Software Requirements Specification), etc.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Analyzing the feasibility, conflicts, and completeness of requirements and creating models like use case diagrams or data flow diagrams to visualize them.

- Requirement Validation
Ensuring all documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with business goals by conducting reviews and walkthroughs.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
These define the specific behaviors or functions of the system.

Examples (Booking Management System):

- Users should be able to create a new booking.

- The system must allow admins to update booking details.

- Customers must receive an email confirmation upon successful booking.

### Non-functional Requirements
These specify the quality attributes of the system.

Examples (Booking Management System):

- The system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users.

- All pages must load within 2 seconds under normal conditions.

- The platform must ensure 99.9% uptime availability.


## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams help visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They are beneficial in illustrating how users will interact with various features of the application.

### Booking System Use Case Diagram:



#### Actors:

- Customer

- Admin

#### Use Cases:

- Register/Login

- Search for bookings

- Create a booking

- Modify/cancel a booking

- Confirm a booking

- Send notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders or the product owner.

### Importance:

- Ensures features meet requirements before delivery

- Prevents ambiguity in feature implementation

- Provides a basis for testing and validation

Example (Checkout Feature in Booking System):

Given a registered user with selected bookings,
When they proceed to checkout,
Then they should be able to enter payment details,
And the system should display a confirmation message upon successful payment.
